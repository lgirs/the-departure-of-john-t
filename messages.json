While there will definitely be a John Tackman gap at Solita after you depart, your work and the deep connections and friendships you've built will continue. I even expect to still see your picture show up in different Solita marketing content for years to come. :) Thank you for being an important person in making the GenAI Studio happen and for all you've done to help push Solita in AI growth over the recent years. Getting to work with you as a part of the Studio has been so much fun. There have been lots of needed laughs during team weekly syncs and in-person gatherings, and lots of learning and challenges. Thank you for all you have done to lead the Studio and specifically the Lab team which has been an important foundation for where Solita needs to go next with AI. Outside of work, I've always appreciated your openness to trying new things, your storytelling, and I'm still waiting for a follow up on the reality show that was filmed in your home. I know that only the best is yet to come for you and there will be lots of adventure ahead. Excited for you and you will have lots of people cheering you on!",

You have the rare skill or ability to be on top of the latest developments and live 'in the future', while at the same time be grounded in the reality (tech and organizational). It has been super inspiring to see how you lead a tech team that is under great pressure and yet is able to progress despite (tech and org) complexity and limited resources - and still have a good spirit. To add to that, I really appreciate that you have been really helpful and available to spar when I asked for that. Looking forward to see where the next adventure takes you :-)",
